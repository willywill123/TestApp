# TestApp
app for senior design
This app is used for the IoT Keyboard and can detect what key you are pressing from the bluetooth keyboard we made. It can also display the typing speed of the user.

The bluetooth module code was used as a reference from this source: https://medium.com/swlh/create-custom-android-app-to-control-arduino-board-using-bluetooth-ff878e998aa8
